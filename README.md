# Umbrella Today
## Project Aim:
As we know, the weather in London is changeable and it often rains. I often forget to bring my umbrella. I want to design a device to hang the door. It can remind me As we know, the weather in London is changeable and it rains a lot. I often forget to bring my umbrella. I wanted to design a device that would hang next to the door. It would remind me if I need an umbrella before I go out by the weather today. At the same time, to save on system consumption, the reminder would only be activated when it detects someone approaching the door.
